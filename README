A simple KML Parser.

UPDATE:

This code is pretty old and isn't actively maintained. I believe Google deprecated ClientLogin
and as such the code won't upload the file. 

This script will parse your KML file, dump it into CSV and upload the file to the 
Google docs account you specify.

1) Beautiful Soup http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
